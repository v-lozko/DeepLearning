Hello, 

Ensure all the .py files, ACGAN.py, WGAN.py, DCGAN.py, HW4_train.py, and HW4_test.py are all in the same folder location.

In order to train the models run HW4_train.py. This file will create the subfolder./models, where it will store the models that
will be needed for evaluation. 

To test/evaluate the models run HW4_test.py. To run this succesfully it will require saved models in the ./models directory.
Running this will generate 1000 images from each model, as well as 1000 from CIFAR10 in order to evaluate the models. The folder
structure should automatically be made if it does not exist.

For any questions please contact valeryl@g.clemson.edu
